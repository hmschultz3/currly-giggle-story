One day there was a man named Joe. Joe had a mental breakdown before a midterm because he didnt study. Don't be like Joe.

Joe had multiple midterms coming up, but he still chose not to study. Over the course of the next week he chose not to study. He failed each of his exams and had another mental breakdown.
