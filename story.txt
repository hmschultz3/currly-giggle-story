One day there was a man named Joe. Joe had a mental breakdown before a midterm because he didnt study. Don't be like Joe.

Joe had
 multiple midterms coming up, but he still chose not to study.
 Over the course of the next week he chose not to study.
 He failed each of his exams and had another mental breakdown.

"Beep! Beep! Beep!" Joe was jolted awake from a deep slumber. "Yes!" He shouted. He hadn't actually failed each of his exams
, he wasn't even a college student. Joe was a unicorn living in Candyland. Joe slammed off his alarm clock with his horn and pranced off to the candycane forest. 

You might wonder why a unicorn living in Candyland, walking towards Candycane Forest has such a lame name such as Joe.
Here's the thing, Joe is lame. He's not like other unicorns around here. He doesn't poop flower rainbow scented ones,
it's just a brown stinky pile of mush. He doesn't prance around gracefully like a prized show horse, it's more like a clutzy 
unconfident walk. Joe's by far the most basic unicorn you'll ever come across.
